<i>“Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991”</i> (Python Institute, 2021). It is suitable for research, prototyping and building production systems, which eliminates the need for using different languages for both. Python has a vast and continuously growing library to choose from which makes it perfect for data analysis, such as Numpy and Pandas. It is a robust, flexible and efficient language which provides many solutions and avenues to approach and solve problems.

The below image demostrates how to import the libraries used for this project:

<u><b>Numpy</b></u> is a Python library used for working with arrays. It produces a narray object. Numpy arrays are faster and more efficient than using python lists. It does this by storing arrays in one place in memory, so they can be accessed and manipulated quickly http://www.numpy.org/

<u><b>Pandas</b></u> is a data manipulation tool built on Numpy. It’s key structure is the dataframe. You can think of a dataframe as a spreadsheet or table but, dataframes as are more efficient and powerful and are an integral part of Python and Numpy. Pandas will allow us to select specific rows and columns within the dataframe. https://pandas.pydata.org/

<u><b>Mathplotlib</b></u> is a python library used to create plots, graphs, charts etc. https://matplotlib.org/

<b>If your system does not have these libaries installed enter the below command from the command line: </b>

```
    $pip install <library name>
```

Now that the modules are imported we can import the dataset.
<ul>
  <li>Download the dataset from XXX</li>
  <li>Import the dataset into python as a csv file using the pandas module.
