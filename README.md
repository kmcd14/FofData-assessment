<h2><b><u><p id='Description'> Description</b></u></p></h2>
This document is relating to matplotlib.pyplot assessment for Fundementals For Data Analysis module. The aim of this project is to research and investigate the matplotlib.pyplot package.

This README contains the documentation for technologies and libraries used for the project. 

The Jupyter Notebook and images used can be found at https://github.com/kmcd14/FofData-assessment.

To access this notebook - numpy-random.ipynb -  you will need to install Python preferably through Anaconda distribution. 


<h3><b><u><p id='Jupyter'>Running Jupyter Notebook</p></b></u></p></h3>
<li>From the command line navigate to the folder you have cloned the  repository.</li>
<li>Type jupyter lab or jupyer notebook into the command line and press enter</li>
<li>Open the numpy-random.ipynb notebook in the browser</li>
<li>To run the code in a cell hold down the shift key and press enter.</li>
<li>To change between edit and read mode at any time press the ESC key.</li>
<li>When you have finished, close the web browser and press Press Ctrl + C on the command line to terminate the programme.</li>

<h3><b><u><p id='Libraries_Used'>Libraries Used:</b></u></p></h3>

<i>“Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991”</i> (Python Institute, 2021). It is suitable for research, prototyping and building production systems, which eliminates the need for using different languages for both. Python has a vast and continuously growing library to choose from which makes it perfect for data analysis, such as Numpy and Pandas. It is a robust, flexible and efficient language which provides many solutions and avenues to approach and solve problems.

<u><b>Numpy</b></u> is a Python library used for working with arrays. It produces a narray object. Numpy arrays are faster and more efficient than using python lists. It does this by storing arrays in one place in memory, so they can be accessed and manipulated quickly http://www.numpy.org/

<u><b>Mathplotlib</b></u> is a python library used to create plots, graphs, charts etc. https://matplotlib.org/

<u><b>Pandas</b></u> is a data manipulation tool built on Numpy. It’s key structure is the dataframe. You can think of a dataframe as a spreadsheet or table but, dataframes as are more efficient and powerful and are an integral part of Python and Numpy. Pandas will allow us to select specific rows and columns within the dataframe. https://pandas.pydata.org/

<u><b>sklearn.datasets</b></u> This package also features helpers to fetch larger datasets commonly used by the machine learning community to benchmark algorithms on data that comes from the ‘real world’. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html

<u><b>Seaborn</b></u> is based on matplotlib and is also used to create data visualisations. “It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.” https://seaborn.pydata.org/


<b>If your system does not have these libaries installed enter the below command from the command line: </b>

```
    $pip install <library name>
```
