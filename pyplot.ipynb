    "Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter [1]. It is an open source plotting library. It is used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and various graphical user interface toolkits like Tkinter, awxPython, etc [2]. Matplotlib is a multiplatform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack [3]. \"Matplotlib was originally written as a Python alternative for MATLAB users, and much of its syntax reflects that fact. The MATLAB-style tools are contained in the pyplot (plt) interface\" [3].\n",
